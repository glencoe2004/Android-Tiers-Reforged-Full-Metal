# Android-Tiers-Reforged-Full-Metal
An addon for Android Tiers Reforged.

Buffs and changes some parts of ATR to be more in line with the original Android Tiers, as well as just adding new and convenient items.

**Makes no attempt to be balanced.**



## Current Changes:
- Fractal pills now work as they did with the old Android Tiers, but now do not have downsides and do not cause mental breaks for mechanical pawns. Ingestion by organics is still highly unadvised.

- Adds the Fractal Injector, a device that is functionally equivalent to 10 doses of the fractal pills. Useful if you have a bunch of them lying around and want to make an army of Terminators quickly.

- Unfeeling is back, and gives bigger bonuses. Additionally, there is a T1-only unfeeling variant that gives a bigger global work speed bonus.

- T1s have been buffed in several major ways:
	- T1s use a new, cheaper recipe. Additionally, T1s no longer require Advanced Components. (seriously why does the T1 use advanced components? It's pretty much DoA when you consider the fact that by the time you have a sufficient supply of ACs to use on effectively disposable androids you're far past the point where they would actually be useful)
	- T1 global work speed buffed from 45% to 55%, in alignment with old AT.
	- As mentioned above, T1s can now be overclocked to gain +15% Global Work Speed
	- Change maintainence rate for T1s from 0.5 to 0.7 (decreases maintainence decay)
	- Change T1 food consumption from 2.4 to 2 (decreases food consumption)
	- Change T1 body size from 0.5 to 0.8, allowing them to store more energy at once
	- Those two changes should make T1s much more usable without making T2s irrelevant.

## Planned changes:
- Add an implant that combines all other implants.
- Add back the Intolerant trait for T5s. 
- Allow T5s to be used with SkyMind.
